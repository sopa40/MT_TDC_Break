2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock nolabel_line61/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock nolabel_line61/inst/clk_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin nolabel_line61/inst/clk_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[0]/C,
FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[1]/C,
FSM_sequential_current_state_reg[2]/C, en_reg/C,

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -284.506 ns between lauch_dff/q_reg/C (clocked by clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz) and capture_dff/q_reg/D (clocked by clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_rx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on pio9 relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
