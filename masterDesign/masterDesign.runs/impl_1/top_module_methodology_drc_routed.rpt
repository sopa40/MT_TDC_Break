2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock nolabel_line89/inst/clk_in is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock nolabel_line89/inst/clk_in is created on an inappropriate internal pin nolabel_line89/inst/clk_in. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -482.152 ns between lauch_dff/q_reg/C (clocked by clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz) and capture_dff/q_reg/D (clocked by clk_out_clock_gen_24MHz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between ring_osc/inv_inferred_i_1/I0 and ring_osc/inv_inferred_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
